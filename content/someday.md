_Someday, I would like to be able to support my family with my passion projects._

I love tinkering with small indie apps, websites, and other projects without thinking about how to monetize them.

Don’t get me wrong, I love working together with other people on interesting projects too, but I would like to reduce the hours, or maybe do it seasonally, if possible.

There’s just something about waking up and spending the day on whatever you feel like. That’s freedom to me.

Usually, people only achieve this kind of freedom when they retire, which is at age 65 or later. I want to “retire” earlier than that, which brings me to my next point…

_Someday, I would like to be financially independent._

I don’t want to be rich, I want to be wealthy. I don’t want to be able to afford luxurious items and expensive vacations, I want to be able to only spend time on things that matter the most to me in life—family, meaningful work, rich experiences.

I believe this is only possible once I no longer have to “care” about money. When cost no longer has to be a factor in my decisions. This means having passive income that covers my expenses.

I realized this in 2016 in my early twenties and have been working towards it ever since. I still have a long way to go, but I’m very excited about it. I might write more about that at some point.

_Someday, I would like to build a home for my family._

I have always loved interior design and architecture, and frequently dream about building my own house someday. I’m still not sure about where to put this house—where we want to settle down—so figuring this out will be the next step.
