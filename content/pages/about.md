I‚Äôm always looking for the _simplest possible solution_ to problems and to life in general. Reducing complexity often has the highest return on investment. Some call me a ‚Äôminimalist‚Äô, but I don‚Äôt like labels.

I‚Äôm _open-minded_. I despise prejudices against people. I find opposing views to my own fascinating, not threatening.

I‚Äôm an _extroverted introvert_. While I love meeting new people and exploring new places, I recharge my energy at home.

I‚Äôm an avid _student of life_. If I‚Äôm not improving my skills or knowledge of the world on a regular basis I get bored. When I don‚Äôt understand I ask why, and set out to find an answer.

I'm a _self-taught Front-End Developer_ with an _MSc in Product Design_. I'm currently mainly working as Head of App Development, creating great user experiences using React Native for both iOS and Android.

## Mission

Thanks to my curiosity, I‚Äôve had the opportunity and will to pursue different paths; web development, graphic design, industrial design, writing, programming, lettering, CAD, among many others.

This pursuit of new knowledge has made me into the _interdisciplinary, borderless creative_ that I am today. By understanding how to work and communicate with people from different backgrounds, I've learned to see potential _outside my own main focus_.

My goal is to apply this knowledge in a way that helps _bring humanity forward_, in some way, either directly through my life‚Äôs work or indirectly by donating my time or my money to a relevant cause.

## Timeline

**1994**: I was born in Lule√•, Sweden.

**2007**: I wrote my first lines of HTML and CSS by following course examples taught by the local school, for students 5 years above me.

**2011**: I took a course in web design and fell in love with Front-End Development. I began working on small web development projects as a hobby.

**2013**: I moved to Gothenburg, Sweden to study Computer Science at the Chalmers University of Technology.

**2014**: I moved back to Lule√•, as Computer Science lacked the aspects of creativity and design that I always liked. At a Starbucks in Kuala Lumpur, I realized that I wanted to study Product Design.

**2015**: I got into typography and lettering, and ended up selling a custom logo shortly after. I interned at a creative agency. I began studies in Industrial Design Engineering at the Lule√• University of Technology in my home town. I didn‚Äôt feel the need to move again.

**2016**: I worked as an in-house graphic designer at a local company. I realized I preferred Front-End Development. I learned that [_‚Äùthe standard pace is for chumps‚Äù_](https://sivers.org/kimo), and set up a plan to graduate in less than the scheduled five years.

**2017**: I signed with a modeling agency in Stockholm, and worked as a model. I traveled quite a bit, mostly to Stockholm, but also to Paris and Milan. I worked as a library assistant at my university.

**2018**: I started [minimal design](http://minimaldesign.se). I began putting my thoughts into writing through articles and journaling. I moved to Sydney for an exchange semester at the University of New South Wales, to gain new perspectives on my engineering-based education by taking art courses. I worked as a CAD process analyst consultant.

**2019**: I realized I wanted to focus my career on Front-End Development. I moved 2,000 km south to Linz, Austria üá¶üáπ, and began working full-time as a Front-End Developer at [Newsadoo](https://newsadoo.com).

**2020**: I graduated with an MSc in Product Design, in four and a half years, after completing my master's thesis on the side of my full-time work. I got promoted to Head of App Development and focused more on creating great user experiences using React Native for iOS and Android.
