<img class="about-me" src="/img/about-me.jpg" alt="Photo of Alex at his desk." />

I‚Äôm always looking for the _simplest possible solution_ to problems and to life in general. Reducing complexity often has the highest return on investment. Some call me a ‚Äôminimalist‚Äô, but I don‚Äôt like labels.

I‚Äôm _open-minded_. I despise prejudices against people. I find opposing views to my own fascinating, not threatening.

I‚Äôm an _extroverted introvert_. While I love meeting new people and exploring new places, I recharge my energy at home.

I‚Äôm an avid _student of life_. If I‚Äôm not improving my skills or knowledge of the world on a regular basis I get bored. When I don‚Äôt understand I ask why, and set out to find an answer.

I'm a _self-taught Front-End Developer_ and _Mobile Engineer_ with an _MSc in Product Design_ who loves to learn and create.

## My mission

Thanks to my curiosity, I‚Äôve had the opportunity and will to pursue different paths; web and app development, graphic design, industrial design, writing, programming, lettering, 3D modeling and rendering, among many others.

This pursuit of new knowledge has made me into the _interdisciplinary, borderless creative_ that I am today. By understanding how to work and communicate with people from different backgrounds, I've learned to see potential _outside my own main focus_.

My goal is to apply this knowledge in a way that helps _bring humanity forward_, in some way, either directly through my life‚Äôs work or indirectly by donating my time or my money to a relevant cause.

## What I'm focusing on currently

I'm currently taking a break from full-time roles after having to [sunset Tempo](/sunsetting-tempo) to spend more time on my own things, like [Tiny Weather](https://tinyweather.app).

I read books, lately more fiction than I normally do, and recently started posting [notes from some of the books I've read](/books/) on this website.

I try to write as much as possible, as it's something I've always enjoyed. I occasionally post something I find worth sharing on this website. Here you can find [a collection of posts](/posts/) I've published.

I still spend time on side-projects, and you can find some of my projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/alexandersandberg).

I recently launched my first own app called [Tiny Weather](/tiny-weather)‚Äîa simple and free weather app.

I'm enjoying life as much as possible. For the first time in many years, I'm not engaged in professional work amounting to more than 40 hours a week, which gives me a lot of time to do whatever I feel like‚Äîeven if that's doing _"nothing"_.

For now I'm not trying to optimize or maximize my free time, just living life one day at a time without expectations. It's great.

## Online presence

I want to reduce my online presence to give more time to what really matters the most to me. Even though I don't spend much time on social media and the like anymore, I still find it to be a distraction of my attention.

But for now you can still find me at the following links, if you want:

## Timeline

**1994**: I was born in Lule√•, Sweden.

**2007**: I wrote my first lines of HTML and CSS by following course examples taught by the local school, for students 5 years above me.

**2011**: I took a course in web design and fell in love with Front-End Development. I began working on small web development projects as a hobby.

**2013**: I moved to Gothenburg, Sweden to study Computer Science at the Chalmers University of Technology.

**2014**: I moved back to Lule√•, as Computer Science lacked the aspects of creativity and design that I always liked. At a Starbucks in Kuala Lumpur, I realized that I wanted to study Product Design.

**2015**: I got into typography and lettering, and ended up selling a custom logo shortly after. I interned at a creative agency. I began studies in Industrial Design Engineering at the Lule√• University of Technology in my home town. I didn‚Äôt feel the need to move again.

**2016**: I worked as an in-house graphic designer at a local company. I realized I preferred Front-End Development. I learned that [_‚Äùthe standard pace is for chumps‚Äù_](https://sivers.org/kimo), and set up a plan to graduate in less than the scheduled five years.

**2017**: I signed with a modeling agency in Stockholm, and worked as a model. I traveled quite a bit, mostly to Stockholm, but also to Paris and Milan. I worked as a library assistant at my university.

**2018**: I started freelancing as a designer and full-stack developer. I began putting my thoughts into writing through articles and journaling. I moved to Sydney for an exchange semester at the University of New South Wales, to gain new perspectives on my engineering-based education by taking art courses. I worked as a CAD process analyst consultant.

**2019**: I realized I wanted to focus my career on Front-End Development. I moved 2,000 km south to Linz, Austria üá¶üáπ, and began working full-time as a Front-End Developer at [Newsadoo](https://newsadoo.com).

**2020**: I graduated with an MSc in Product Design, one semester ahead of schedule, after completing my master's thesis on the side of my full-time work. I got promoted to Head of App Development and focused more on creating great user experiences using React Native for iOS and Android. I got promoted (again) to Head of Product Experience, taking on the responsibility of creating the best possible experience for our users, while still being the lone App developer at my company.

**2021**: I set a goal for myself to transition to working full-time on a product that I love at a company with values similar to my own. A few months later I joined [Tempo](https://yourtempo.co) as a React Native Developer.
