I **finished my MSc in Product Design**, one semester earlier than scheduled. I hope to finally find some time for personal projects again, now that my master's thesis is finished.

At work, I'm now mainly focusing on developing apps for both iOS and Android using React Native, as the new **Head of App Development**. I'm really enjoying this new responsibility.

I hope to find the motivation to **write more in the coming months**, as I truly enjoy the practice of putting my thoughts into writing. But we'll see whether that's on this blog or in my personal journal.

Other than that, **life in Linz is amazing**. I can't imagine a better place to be in right now. I'm very grateful for everything that has happened to me since moving here, and I'm really excited to see what the future will bring.
