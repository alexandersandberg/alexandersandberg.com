I hope you are doing fine in these difficult times. The situation in Austria is getting better but still not under control. I'm doing fine, though.

I'm still working on **my App** whenever I have time. I delayed the launch until the end of January, but I will have to push it another month again. But the primary purpose and focus—apart from having a good time—is still my learning, so there's no rush. But I'm certainly excited to launch my first (own) App soon!
