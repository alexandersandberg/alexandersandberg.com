I'm doing fine, despite the COVID-19 situation. The last 2 months almost have been spent mostly at home, including work. But I'm grateful to have chosen a career where I'm only dependent on a laptop and an internet connection.

Austria in general has done well during these times though, and life is starting to get back to (kinda) normalâ€¦ for now.

The last few days I worked on **updating this website**. My main goal was to make changes that would both make it easier to and also inspire me to post more content.

I also made some design changes, implemented dark mode, and refactored the whole website.
