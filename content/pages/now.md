I hope you reading this is doing fine in these difficult times.

In August, I took on a new position at my curreny company as **Head of Product Experience** in parallel to my role as Front-End (App) Developer. It's a great fit considering my MSc in Product Design and I'm enjoying the responsibility of creating the best possible experience for our users.

I have some really exciting things going on in my life with a **personal App product** being one of them. I initiated the project to improve my React Native, TypeScript (wow), and automated testing skills, but am now focusing on **launching it before the end of the year**. I'll keep you posted.
