About a year ago I was nominated by my home university, Luleå University of Technology (LTU) in northern Sweden, for exchange studies at University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia. Even before I started studying at LTU I had plans for exchange studies before I graduated. I think it's my interest in personal development and my urge to see new things that has inspired me to pursue this. Luleå is a great city, but it's going to be exciting with a change in environment and culture, since I've spent most of my life there.

When I applied for exchange studies, LTU only had two spots available at UNSW, and somehow I managed to get one of those (THANKS!). All LTU-students who went for exchange studies this school year decided to go during the autumn term, except for me of course who chose the spring term. In other words I'll be the only LTU-student down in Australia this next semester, which is going to be exciting!

If you have any questions regarding exchange studies, UNSW, Sydney, or *almost* anything else, I'd love to [hear from you](mailto:alexandberg@gmail.com). If I'm lazy (always) there's a chance I'll just post something on Instagram ([@sandbergalexander](https://instagram.com/sandbergalexander)) instead of writing a blog post.
