I had somewhat of a revelation two weeks ago, and finally decided to focus my career on **web development**.

After being uncertain about what to do with my life for so long, it's nice to finally settle down with a **clear focus**. I'll still pursue other hobbies of mine, of course, but *not with the intention of making a career out of it*, which is nice.

**Simplicity** and **flexibility** are qualities I'll always value highly in life, and it's hard to beat the simple and flexible career as a web developer. All you really need is a computer and an internet connection. *Not being location dependent opens up a lot of possibilities*, which is very attractive to me at this point in my life.

The coming months, I'll finish up my last university courses, improve my skills as a web developer (about to learn React), and try to find a company to collaborate with on my **master's thesis project**.

I'm super excited.
