I recently started my fourth year out of five of my Industrial design engineering degree. It's exciting knowing that around a year and two months from now, I'll be **graduating** and getting my life started for real (<small>or at least that's what it feels like</small>).

Most of my free time at the moment is (like always) spent on side-projects that will help me grow as a designer and human being.

I finally got serious with **LinkedIn** and set up a proper account ([let's connect!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandbergalex/)), since I wanted to take advantage of the potential there for me—in my current situation, close to graduating—to find opportunities for the future.

I also started **writing more**, and you can find my latest posts on [inspiration for creativity](https://alexandersandberg.com/inspiration/) and [motivation](https://alexandersandberg.com/motivation/) here on the website.
