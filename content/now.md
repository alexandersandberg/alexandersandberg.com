I recently finished up my last university courses, and will this coming fall start with my **master's thesis project**.

I'm currently **looking for a company to collaborate with** on this final step of my product design degree.

The project focus is pretty flexible, but should mainly center around **UI/UX and front-end development**, and will amount to 800 hours of work.

I hope to find an environment for this project in which I can grow, both professionally and as a human being. I see great value in the potential of staying at the company after the project is done. Also, I'm willing to relocate *anywhere*.

If you, or someone you know, might be interested in collaborating with me on this project, please get in touch with me at *hi@alexandersandberg.com*!

You can find some more information about me and my work on my ['About me' page](/about).
