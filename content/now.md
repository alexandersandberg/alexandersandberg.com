In less than a year from now I'll be **graduating** from university with a master's degree in *industrial design engineering*. I'm currently looking for opportunities for a master's thesis project, and actually have a pretty interesting plan to do this. I won't go into details now, but it involves ads.

I'm working on a really exciting project with **[minimal design](http://minimaldesign.se)** for a client. I think it's going to be huge. I'm also casually trying to **write articles** here and there. I recently posted [The unexpected power of daydreaming](https://alexandersandberg.com/daydreaming/), which I really enjoyed putting together.
