I just finished a _complete re-design and re-write of this website_ ([let me know](mailto:{{ metadata.author.email }}) what you think). I went with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) this timeâ€”it's amazing! As always, you can find the source code [on GitHub]({{ metadata.source }}).

I'm spending as much time as I can _learning more about SwiftUI_. Our [Practice iOS app](https://practice.do/ios) is still mainly written in UIKit, but that might change soon!

I started working on _another iOS/macOS app_ that was missing from my life. Nothing to announce yet though, but [stay tuned](https://twitter.com/{{ metadata.author.twitter }}).

I integrated reading into my daily morning routine and now _read a lot more than usual_. I love it. You can see what I'm reading on [Literal](https://literal.club/alex).

It's getting warmer outside and I'm planning to _grow something_ on our balcony this year. I'm very excited. ðŸŒ±
