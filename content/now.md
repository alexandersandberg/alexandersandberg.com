I finally **finished my MSc in Product Design**, one semester earlier than scheduled.

I'm now mainly focusing on developing apps for both iOS and Android apps using React Native, as the new **Head of App Development**.

I hope to find motivation to **write more the coming months**, as I truly enjoy the practice of putting my thoughts into writing. But we'll see whether that's on this blog or in my personal journal.
