I decided to make a quite drastic change to the website recently. ”Simple” has been a very influential keyword for my way of living the last two years or so, and the process of writing a post in this journal did not reflect that.

I decided to stop writing posts in swedish, since all swedes know english anyways. This drastically cut the writing time down. I also decided to stop using fancy formatting like small cap letters in the beginning of the post, abbreviation tags and that kind of stuff. The image processing was also drastically simplified, which I’m not going to get into.

I want to focus more on writing interesting content instead of making it look perfect in every possible way. I still get 80% of the results with only 20% of the effort (according to Pareto), and I’m very okay with that.
