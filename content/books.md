I used to keep a collection of notes from some of the books I read here. Nowadays, many of these notes are organized into [life lessons](/{{ pages.lessons.path }}) and can be found there.

If you're curious about what I'm reading currently, you can check out [my Literal profile](https://literal.club/alex).

If you miss the old book notes, [let me know](mailto:{{ metadata.author.email}}).
