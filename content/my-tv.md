Almost three months have passed since I left Sweden for Austria, and in the process left most of my belongings behind.

As the last few years of my life have been inspired by minimalism and simple living, I didn't actually have many things to leave behind in the first place. It was nice with a fresh start nonetheless.

I could furnish my new apartment according to the preferences of my present self. I didn't have to worry about accumulated stuff that I wasn't ready to get rid of yet, even though it didn't bring me joy anymore.

One of the things I left behind was my TV.

I never had an unhealthy habit of watching too much TV, as I always kept myself busy with various projects. Watching TV was actually more of a healthy activity—an opportunity for me to take a break from my work.

But despite the little time I did use my TV, _there was a lot of complexity in my life because of it_.

It was a pain to move, all six times. I needed a TV stand to hold all my electronics connected to it and comfortable seating in front of it—just at the right distance. _My interior arrangements had to be determined by the placement of this bulky combination_. And let's not forget to mention all the expenses that came with it; from initial costs to the extra square meters needed.

_My TV added a lot of constraints and complications to my life with little value in return._

But living without a TV for these few months has not only reduced the physical clutter in my life. When boredom comes around there's no longer a TV reminding me of the easy way out.

This has helped me _resist the temptations of instant gratification_. Now I spend more time reading books, listening to music, and going for long walks in the city.

Not always having a TV around also _encourages human interaction_ with the people in your life—something I think most people could benefit from nowadays, including me.

I still watch the occasional movie or TV show on my laptop from the comfort of my armchair or bed, but it's no longer something I gravitate towards whenever I have some time to waste.

_It's a remarkably liberating feeling._
