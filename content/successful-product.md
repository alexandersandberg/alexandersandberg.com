People don't care about your product, only the *result* that comes from using it.

1. Identify a problem in people's lives
2. Build something to fix it better than what's already out there
3. Create a brand behind the product that portrays the right message
4. Deliver the promised *result*

The following quote does a good job explaining step 3:

> "People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it."
> <cite>— Simon Sinek</cite>

But don't forget, you should never start something with the sole intention of making money.
