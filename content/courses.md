One of the requirements for exchange studies is that you're studying full time. At UNSW this would be 24 UOC, but it differs between universities in Australia. If you don't follow the rules about full time studies, you'll unfortunately lose your student visa.

After a lot of consideration I ended up applying for three courses, since one of them was worth 12 UOC; *Introductory Japanese A*, *Spatial Design: Experimental Domestic Spaces* and *Design Studio 3: Production*. When I looked closer at the last one I noticed it was pretty much the same as one of the courses I have taken at my home university, so I decided to change that one. Since I've had an interest in photography for a while, but never had much experience with it, I decided to switch to two photography courses instead. Both courses were unfortunately full since several months back, but after a few emails to the course convenor I managed to get a spot in each one anyways.

It's not just about finding courses you like, you also have to make sure they don't clash. For every course you apply for you choose yourself between different days of classes. If you're late with this most of the “better” classes are already full. If a class you really wish to attend is already full you can either wait for someone to give up their spot, or send an email to the course convenor. I managed to fix a course clash by simply sending an email, despite the class being full.

### Introductory Japanese A
I've been inspired by japanese culture for long, especially when it comes to architecture, accomodation, design and in general their look on life. Even before I left for Sydney I had planned to travel to Japan after my exchange to experience the country for real. To make the trip more worthwhile I thought it'd be fun to learn some japanese before hand, to make the communication easier.

### Spatial Design: Experimental Domestic Spaces
My fascination for Japan (more specifically their look on accomodation) also inspired me to choose this course, which is about exploring the concept of “home”. The course consist of many areas from drawing, model making and CAD to visualise different concepts.

### Making: Photography och Digital Fine Art Photography
The last two courses are like I mentioned about photography. Making: Photography bring up the history from analog to digital photography and here you will get a chance to try both. Digital Fine Art Photography is focusing on the art of creating interesting images with a camera with different techniques.
