**Hi, I'm Alex.**

I’m a self-taught, **product-minded iOS/macOS Engineer** with a background in web development and product design.

Due to my curiosity for both design and development, I love working on meaningful products in close collaboration with designers and product people, and being part of the "why".

By day I work as an iOS Engineer at [Composer](https://composer.trade)—an all-in-one platform for building, backtesting, and executing trading algorithms with the help of AI.

By night I like to build apps that I wish existed. I built [Tiny Weather](/apps/tiny-weather) because I couldn't find a beautiful, simple, privacy-minded weather app. I built [Tiny Softbox](/apps/tiny-softbox) to fix my bad office lighting. I built [Balance](/apps/balance) to help myself and others find work-life balance.

I'm a member of the [Swift Website Workgroup](https://www.swift.org/website-workgroup/)—a steering team that helps guide the evolution of the Swift.org website.

Other than that, I like taking each day as it comes.

I'm not spending much time on social media anymore in an attempt to regain lost focus, but I love connecting with people over email.

Feel free to [introduce yourself](mailto:{{ metadata.author.email }})!
