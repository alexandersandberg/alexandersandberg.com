When you're travelling to a country with a culture that differs from your own it's important to go with an open mind, free of prejudices. Before I moved to Sydney I hadn't even thought what kind of people the Australians were. But when I subconsciously didn't have any bigger expectations than the Americans (no offense!) I was positively surprised when I realised how nice everyone were.

Instead of the regular *"hello"* that you are used to being greeted with in Sweden, you usually get a complimentary *"how is’t going?"* or *"how are you?"* as well. I haven't really learned to be as polite in return since I'm still slightly surprised every time I hear it. Instead I often just express a simple *"hello"* back, but I'm working on it.

During my soon three weeks in Sydney I have at multiple occasions gone up to strangers on the street asking all sorts of questions. I have yet to get a less than nice reply back. It seems like everyone is more than happy to help a lost foreigner out. All the Australians I've met at the university, on the beach, and at bars and clubs have all been really nice as well.

But the thing that fascinates me the most is when the majority of all bus travelers give off a *"thank you!"* to the driver whenever they get off the back of the bus. This is something I've never experienced in Sweden before. I tried this myself when I got off the bus at the university today, and received a warm *"no worries!"* back. It finally felt like I deserved a place among Sydney's locals. I have to make that a habit…
