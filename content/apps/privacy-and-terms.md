### Privacy

To help me improve the app, some anonymous usage data is collected. No personal data is collected—it's only stored on your own device.

I use Mixpanel for this. See [Mixpanel's Privacy Statement](https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/) for more information. You can opt-out of this in the Balance app settings.

To help me manage Pro subscriptions, I use RevenueCat. This is also processed anonymously. See [RevenueCat's Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/) for more information.

### Terms

Balance is a "freemium" app which means it's completely free to install and use, but gives you the option to subscribe to a Pro version to unlock more features.

These subscriptions are processed and managed by Apple, and you can read more about that in [Apple's support article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202023).

[Apple's Terms of Use (EULA)](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/) applies.

### Privacy

I do not collect or store any of your data. That's it!

### Terms

Tiny Softbox is a paid app. After paying a one-time fee on the App Store, you will have lifetime access to the app on all your devices.

Tiny Weather is a free app. You can install and use the app and all of its features completely for free. If you would like to support the development of the app, there's an option to donate from within the app.
