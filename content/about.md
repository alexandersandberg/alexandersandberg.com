## Who I am

I’m **curious**. If I’m not improving my skills or knowledge of the world on a regular basis I get bored. When I don’t understand I ask why and set out to find an answer.

I'm **open-minded**. I embrace my mistakes and learn from them. I avoid prejudices and find opposing views to my own fascinating, not threatening.

I'm **simple**. I often opt for the simplest possible path or solution. Some call me a "minimalist", but I try to avoid labels. We are _the average of the five labels we assign ourselves_, <a class="subhead foreground-tertiary" href="/{{ pages.lessons.path }}239" aria-label="Go to reference"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and I like being free.

I’m an **extroverted introvert**. While I love meeting new people and exploring new places, I recharge my energy at home.

I'm **Swedish**, but I live in Austria since 2019.

## What I do

I’m a self-taught, **product-minded iOS/macOS Developer** with a background in web development and product design.

Due to my curiosity for both design and development, I love working on meaningful products in close collaboration with designers and product people, and being part of the "why".

By day I work as an iOS Developer at [Practice](https://practice.do) where I, together with an amazing team, build a tool that helps individuals run their entire practices and coaching businesses from one place.

By night I like to build [apps](/apps/) that solve problems or satisfy needs that other apps haven't yet. I built [Tiny Weather](/apps/tiny-weather/) because I couldn't find a beautiful, simple, privacy-minded weather app. I built [Tiny Softbox](/apps/tiny-softbox/) to fix my bad office lighting. I'm building [Balance](/apps/balance/) to help people achieve and maintain work-life balance.

I'm a member of the [Swift Website Workgroup](https://www.swift.org/website-workgroup/) (SWWG)—a steering team that helps guide the evolution of the [Swift.org](https://www.swift.org) website.

Other than that, I like taking each day as it comes.

## Where you can find me

This website is my home on the internet, but you can also find me elsewhere.

I use **Twitter** to share random things and thoughts and to connect with like-minded people. You can follow me [@{{ metadata.author.twitter }}](https://twitter.com/{{ metadata.author.twitter }}).

As I'm a supporter of free speech, I'm also on **Mastodon**. You can follow me there at [{{ metadata.author.mastodonHandle }}]({{ metadata.author.mastodonUrl }}).

On **GitHub**, you can find some of my open-source projects. You can find me at [@{{ metadata.author.github }}](https://github.com/{{ metadata.author.github }}).

I don't use **LinkedIn** much but you can still find me on there [@{{ metadata.author.linkedin }}](https://linkedin.com/in/{{ metadata.author.linkedin }}).

You can also reach out to me via **email** at [{{ metadata.author.email }}](mailto:{{ metadata.author.email }}). \
<small>I'm **not** interested in your app services or million-dollar inheritances, but I appreciate the thought.</small>
