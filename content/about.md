I’m always looking for the _simplest possible solution_ to problems and to life in general. Some call me a ’minimalist’, but I don’t like labels.

I’m _open-minded_. I despise prejudices against people. I find opposing views to my own fascinating, not threatening.

I’m an _extroverted introvert_. I love meeting and chatting with new people and walking around, exploring big cities, but I recharge my energy at home.

I’m an avid _student of life_. If I’m not constantly improving my skills or knowledge of the world, I get bored. When I don’t understand I ask why, and set out to find an answer.

I'm a _self-taught Front-End Developer_ with a soon completed _MSc in Product Design_, with an interest in <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> and <abbr title="Accessibility">a11y</abbr>; creating _user-friendly and accessible experiences for everyone_.

## Mission

Thanks to my curiosity, I’ve had the opportunity and will to pursue many different creative things; web development, graphic design, industrial design, writing, programming, photography, lettering, CAD, among others.

This pursuit of new knowledge has made me into the interdisciplinary, borderless creative that I am today. I’ve learned to work and communicate among people with different backgrounds.

My goal is to find a job/mission that I not just want to do, but _live_; something that I don’t mind sacrificing my free time for. Something I would do even if money was not an issue.

Meanwhile, I want to help bring humanity forward in some way, either directly through my life’s work, or indirectly by donating time or money to a relevant cause.

## Timeline

**1994**: Born in Luleå, Sweden.

**2007**: Wrote my first lines of HTML and CSS by following course examples taught by the local school, for students 5 years above me.

**2011**: Took a course in web design and fell in love with front-end development. Began working on small webdev projects as a hobby.

**2013**: Moved to Gothenburg, Sweden to study computer science at Chalmers University of Technology.

**2014**: Moved back to Luleå, as computer science lacked the aspects of design that I always liked. At a Starbucks in Kuala Lumpur I realized that I wanted to study product design.

**2015**: Got into typography and lettering, and ended up selling a custom logo. Interned at a creative agency. Began studies in industrial design engineering at Luleå University of Technology. Didn’t feel the need to move again.

**2016**: Worked as an in-house graphic designer at a local company. Realized I preferred front-end development. Learned that [_”the standard pace is for chumps”_](https://sivers.org/kimo), and set up a plan to graduate in less than the expected five years.

**2017**: Signed with a modeling agency in Stockholm, and worked as a model. Traveled quite a bit, mostly to Stockholm, but also Paris and Milan. Worked as a library assistant at my university.

**2018**: Started [minimal design](http://minimaldesign.se). Began putting my thoughts into writing through articles and journaling. Moved to Sydney for an exchange semester at University of New South Wales, to gain new perspectives on my engineering-based education, by taking arts courses. Worked as a CAD process analyst consultant.

**2019**: Realized I wanted to focus my career on front-end development. Moved 2,000 km south to Linz, Austria 🇦🇹, and began working full-time as a Front-End Developer at [Newsadoo](https://newsadoo.com).

<small>(**2020**: Graduated with a MSc in product design, in four and a half years.)</small>
