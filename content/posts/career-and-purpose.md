”Reframe your thinking 'what your career can do for you' into 'what can your career do for others.’”

---

---

What do I do? Who do I do it for? And why do they need it?

You know you’ve found the right occupation when you’re more alive at the end of your work day than at the start.

---

We make a dying at work so we can live it up on the weekend.

---

Ask yourself how you would spend your time if you could take a year off with pay.

---

---

To operate within an interdisciplinary environment, an individual needs to have strengths in two dimensions, e.g. architects who studied psychology, artists with MBAs, engineers with marketing experience.

Create value before asking something in return, e.g. when looking for a new job, or when asking for advice from someone.

---

> Sometimes you just gotta make the decision and jump.

---

What’s the worst that could happen?

---

”If you don’t make mistakes, you’re not working on hard enough problems. And that’s a big mistake.” - Frank Wilczek

---

”Only those who sleep make no mistakes.” - Ingvar Kamprad

---

You learn from your mistakes, but only after you notice and admit them first.

---

> Many people become so obsessed with being ”right” about their life that they never end up actually living it.
