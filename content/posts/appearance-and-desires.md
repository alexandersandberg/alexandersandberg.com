Desire is the source of all suffering.

We all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.

> ”One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted. Then they begin to count on it. Finally they reach a point where they can’t live without it.”
> <cite>— Yuval Harari</cite>

Once you’ve tasted living lavishly, it can be difficult to go back. Be careful about setting your standards too high.

People buy luxury branded items to treat their insecurity, but it’s only a temporary numbness.

Money talks, wealth whispers.

> "…just as early industrial capitalism moved the focus of existence from _being to having_, post-industrial culture has moved that focus from _having to appearing_."

People don’t need enormous cars, they need respect. They don’t need closets full of clothes, they need to feel attractive and they need excitement and variety and beauty. People don’t need electronic equipment; they need something worthwhile to do with their lives.

Other people are probably so busy trying to impress you that they will, at best, not notice your efforts.

Pleasure is great, but it’s a horrible value to prioritize your life around.

> A confident man doesn’t feel a need to prove that he’s confident. A rich woman doesn’t feel a need to convince anybody that she’s rich.

We instinctually measure ourselves against others and vie for status. The question isn't whether we evaluate ourselves against others; rather, the question is _by what standard do we measure ourselves_?

Status is a zero-sum game: if someone is going to win, there also has to be a loser.
