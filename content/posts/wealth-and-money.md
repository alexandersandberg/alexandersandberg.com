Money is something we choose to trade our life energy for.

The purpose of wealth is freedom.

> ”Some people are so poor, all they have is money.”

A rich person doesn’t have to tell you they’re rich.

He who knows he has enough is rich.

Once one is able to provide for basic physical needs (food, shelter, and so on), the correlation between happiness and worldly success quickly approaches zero.

> The more you desperately want to be rich, the more poor and unworthy you feel—regardless of how much money you actually make.

You won’t get rich renting out your time. You must own equity in a business to gain financial freedom.

Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep.

There are no get rich quick schemes. That’s just someone else getting rich off you.

> Build the life you want, **then** save for it. Otherwise your life won't be worth living.

When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize that _it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place_.
