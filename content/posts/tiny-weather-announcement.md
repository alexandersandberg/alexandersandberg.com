Last year I started working on a small app project to improve my skills in React Native, TypeScript, and automated testing.

It was also a chance for me to help do something about all the ad-heavy, cluttered, complicated, privacy-lacking weather apps there are on the app stores. And _‚Äùthe best way to complain is to make something"_, so that's what I did.

I'm making an app that primarily focuses on solving _my own needs_. I think that's a good approach to making a great product. It's a lot more difficult to try to solve someone else's needs.

Tiny Weather is still a work in progress, but I'm hoping to launch it in a month or two for both iOS and Android.

I set up a Twitter account ([@tinyweatherapp](https://twitter.com/tinyweatherapp)) where I will try to #buildinpublic and share my progress along the way. Following me there is also the best way to find out when I launch the app.

And please let me know if you're interested in beta testing the app. I would be thrilled to show it off and hopefully get some feedback!

I also made a quick landing page which I will update over time as I get closer to launch: [tinyweather.app](https://tinyweather.app)

I will get back to work now. üë®‚Äçüíª
