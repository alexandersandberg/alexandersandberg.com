A<span class="small-caps">bout a year ago i was nominated</span> by my home university, Luleå University of Technology <abbr>(LTU)</abbr> in northern Sweden, for exchange studies at University of New South Wales <abbr>(UNSW)</abbr> in Sydney, Australia. Even before I started studying at <abbr>LTU</abbr> I had plans for exchange studies before I graduated. I think it's my interest in personal development and my urge to see new things that has inspired me to pursue this. Luleå is a great city, but it's going to be exciting with a change in environment and culture, since I've spent most of my life there.

When I applied for exchange studies, <abbr>LTU</abbr> only had two spots available at <abbr>UNSW</abbr>, and somehow I managed to get one of those (<small>THANKS!</small>). All <abbr>LTU</abbr>-students who went for exchange studies this school year decided to go during the autumn term, except for me of course who chose the spring term. In other words I'll be the only LTU-student down in Australia this next semester, which is going to be exciting!

## Travelling to sydney

Monday February 12th I'll start my journey from Luleå. 27 hours and 10 minutes later excluding ~~possible~~ guaranteed delays, I'll arrive in Sydney after two layovers; Stockholm and Doha (<small>for future references… one-way ticket <abbr>ARN-SYD</abbr>; 4631 <abbr>SEK</abbr> with Qatar Airways</small>). Below I've made a highly accurate sketch of my itinerary, because it's always nice with some pictures to look at instead of just boring text.

The living situation in Sydney is still a “work in progress”, but I've found an apartment on Airbnb for the first week at least, while I look around for a more permanent place to stay at. I'll come back to this in a later post.

## Why a blog?

On the blog I intend to share my time in Sydney and my exchange at <abbr>UNSW</abbr>, to hopefully inspire more people to do the same thing. I'll do my best to share interesting and meaningful stuff with you, but I can't promise it'll be worth while, so I apologise in advance!

If you have any questions regarding exchange studies, <abbr>UNSW</abbr>, Sydney, or *almost* anything else, I'd love to [hear from you](mailto:hi@alexandersandberg.com). If I'm lazy (<small>always</small>) there's a chance I'll just post something on Instagram ([@sandbergalexander](https://instagram.com/sandbergalexander)) instead of writing a blog post.

February 19th is the start of O(<small>rientation</small>)-Week, which is a week filled with activities, parties, and other fun stuff to learn more about the university and meet other students. I might share something from that, if I remember. Anyways, I want to thank you for taking your time to read this post! If you scrolled to the bottom and only read this sentence, I appreciate that too.
