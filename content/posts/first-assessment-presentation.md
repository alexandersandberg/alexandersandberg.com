I <span class="small-caps">recently had my first assessment presentation</span> since starting at <abbr>UNSW</abbr>. We had to present a series of photos with the theme “city” in the course *Digital Fine Art Photography*. I chose to work in the area of abstract architecture where I tried to capture some interesting buildings in Sydney on picture.

    srcset="
    /img/_DSC3490_mbrtwd_c_scale,w_540.jpg 540w,
    /img/_DSC3490_mbrtwd_c_scale,w_972.jpg 972w,
    /img/_DSC3490_mbrtwd_c_scale,w_1200.jpg 1200w"
    src="/img/_DSC3490_mbrtwd_c_scale,w_1200.jpg"
    alt="My photos hanging on the wall.">

To not steal the focus away from the geometry and patterns in the photos I decided to work with black and white. The next assessment however is about color and how you manage these while printing your photos, which is a common problem.
