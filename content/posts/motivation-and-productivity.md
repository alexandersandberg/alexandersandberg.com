Your energy level is affected by posture; if you lay down in your bed, you’ll feel tired. If you slouch on the couch, you’ll feel lazy and put the tv on. To work, you need a productive posture, e.g. sitting at a desk, to keep your energy levels up.

Don't reflect on something if the reflection takes longer than the task, e.g. taking care of dishes.

Consumption of direct inspiration kills the motivation to focus on your own innovation due to comparison.

Many people look up and see the mountaintop, but they don’t see the mountain. They don’t perceive that the gap between what they have and what they want is filled with work; work punctuated with intermittent and painful failures. So they sit at base camp, seeking praise for brewing a perfect pot of kombucha, waiting for the helicopter to take them up, instead of climbing.

…so don’t sit around and wait for insights or luck.

Getting fired is the best thing that could happen to any of us. That way, we’d quit treading water and do something with our lives.

Set clear, tangible, and measurable deadlines, e.g. ”send five job applications” vs. ”send more job applications”. It’s easy to be intimidated by open-ended goals.

Shitty values involve tangible external goals outside of our control. The pursuit of these goals causes great anxiety. And even if we manage to achieve them, they leave us feeling empty and lifeless, because once they’re achieved there are no more problems to solve.

Better values are process-oriented, something like ”express myself honestly to others.” A metric for the value ”honesty,” is never completely finished.
