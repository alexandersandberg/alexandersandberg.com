I recently came across a very interesting human being named Matthew Walker, after he appeared on two of the few podcasts that I’m currently keeping up with.

He talked about the importance of sleep and how the lack of sleep could potentially be one of the biggest problems in society today. Even a pretty standard (at least for me) six hours per night could have a huge impact on your life long-term.

I found [Joe Rogan’s podcast with Matthew](https://youtu.be/pwaWilO_Pig) most interesting and in-depth, but he also appears on the Kevin Rose Show (just google it).

Matthew also published a book on the subject called _Why We Sleep_, which I put in my reading queue without hesitation. I’m currently busy finishing up one of Haruki Murakami’s masterpieces though, so I’ll get to it eventually.
