Reading and experience train your model of the world. And even if you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model of the world persists. Your mind is like a compiled program you’ve lost the source of; _it works, but you don’t know why_.

---

Curiosity is ever-lasting.

---

Don’t ask what?, ask _why?_

People who base their self-worth on being right about everything prevent themselves from learning from their mistakes. They lack the ability to take on new perspectives and empathize with others. They close themselves off to new and important information.

Conventional life advice, all the positive and happy self-help stuff we hear all the time, is actually fixating on what you lack. You follow dating and relationship advice because you feel that you’re unlovable already.

---

If you’re dreaming of something all the time, then you’re reinforcing the same unconscious reality over and over: that you are not that.

---

> Ever notice that sometimes when you care less about something, you do better at it?
