Look inward whenever there is an issue that is happening outward.

Sometimes life sucks, and the healthiest thing you can do is admit it.

Treat yourself like someone you love.

A traveler came upon three individuals working with stone. Curious as to what these workers were doing, the traveler approached the first worker and asked, _”what are you doing?”_ Without the slightest hesitation, the worker replied _”I am a stone cutter and I am cutting stones.”_ Still unclear of the workers’ task, the traveler approached the second worker and asked the same question. To this the second worker though for a moment, gazed briefly at the traveler and explained, _”I am a stone cutter and I am cutting stones to earn money to support my family.”_ Perplexed by the two different responses, the sojourner approached the third worker and asked, _”what are you doing?”_ Stopping for a moment, the worker started at the stone in his hand, slowly turned to the traveler, and said, _”I am a stone cutter and I am building a cathedral!”_

Peace is not found through understanding, more striving, or more achieving. Peace is found through greater acceptance.

If you want to increase happiness by spending money, replace salient negatives instead of adding positives.

Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase.

Happiness is internal. Your external situation might have an affect, but it all comes down to how you decide to live with it.

”We are more interested in making others believe we are happy than in trying to be happy ourselves.” – François de la Rochefoucauld

One sure way to not making it some day is losing hope, so don’t do that.

"Believe in yourself and others will believe in you".

”Act like you’ve already achieved it."

”Once you say you’re going to settle for second, that’s what happens to you in life.” - John F. Kennedy

"If you aren't in the moment, you are either looking forward to uncertainty, or back to pain and regret.” - Jim Carrey
