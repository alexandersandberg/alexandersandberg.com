After a few weeks of testing with over 500 beta testers, I'm super excited to finally launch Tiny Weather! 🚀

<!--more-->

I initially started the project as a way for me to improve my skills in React Native and TypeScript by "learning by doing". As I thought a simple, free, and privacy-focused weather app was missing from the App/Play Store I decided to release it.

You can download it here for free: [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiny-weather-simple-forecasts/id1522059185) · [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alexandersandberg.tinyweather)

A big thanks to everyone who helped and supported me! But I'm only getting started—I have a lot of changes planned already. ☁️

You can follow the development of the app on Twitter [@tinyweatherapp](https://twitter.com/tinyweatherapp).

More information is available on the Tiny Weather website: https://tinyweather.app
