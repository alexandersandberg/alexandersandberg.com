A<span class="small-caps">ttack feet loved it, hated it</span>, loved it, hated it and ears back wide eyed pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box cat mojo hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy dream about hunting birds. Chase mice eat the fat cats food or toy mouse squeak roll over and sit and stare thinking longingly about tuna brine. See owner, run in terror catch mouse and gave it as a present love to play with owner's hair tie for dead stare with ears cocked always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose.

Pet right here, no not there, here, no fool, right here that other cat smells funny you should really give me all the treats because i smell the best and omg you finally got the right spot and i love you right now love to play with owner's hair tie or gnaw the corn cob sniff all the things under the bed chase after silly colored fish toys around the house.

Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap. All of a sudden cat goes crazy vommit food and eat it again. Cat ass trophy chase red laser dot slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish yet sit on the laptop or lick the curtain just to be annoying meow loudly just to annoy owners missing until dinner time. Cat is love, cat is life.
