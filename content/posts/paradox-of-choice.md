bookSummary: When all the costs (in time, money, and anguish) involved in getting information about all the options are factored in, satisficing is the maximizing strategy.
---

If you seek and accept only the best, you are a maximizer.

---

To satisfice is to settle for something that is good enough and not worry about the possibility that there might be something better.

> When all the costs (in time, money, and anguish) involved in getting information about all the options are factored in, satisficing is the maximizing strategy.

---

When we are making decisions, we should think about how each of the options will feel not just tomorrow, but months or even years later.

---

> We can remind ourselves to be grateful for what we have.

---

The blessing of modest expectations is that they leave room for many experiences to be a pleasant surprise.

---

> Having control over one’s life matters.

---

Helplessness induced by failure or lack of control leads to depression if a person’s causal explanations for that failure are global, chronic, and personal.

---

> “Optimists” explain successes with chronic, global, and personal causes and failures with transient, specific, and universal ones. “Pessimists” do the reverse.

---

It is the pessimists and maximizers who are candidates for depression.
