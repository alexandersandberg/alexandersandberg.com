Timing is often the biggest component of success.

---

If you study people who succeed, you will see that most of them follow systems, not goals.

---

> If you want success, figure out the price, then pay it.

---

Generous people take care of their own needs first. In fact, doing so is a moral necessity. The world needs you at your best.

---

Optimizing is often the strategy of people who have specific goals and feel the need to do everything in their power to achieve them. Simplifying is generally the strategy of people who view the world in terms of systems.

> If your life doesn’t provide you with plenty of happy thoughts to draw upon, try daydreaming of wonderful things in your future.

---

The easiest way to manage your attitude is to consume as much feel-good entertainment as you can.

---

No matter what you want to do in life, higher energy will help you get there.

---

> Avoid friends who are full-time downers.

---

> One helpful rule of thumb for knowing where you might have a little extra talent is to consider what you were obsessively doing before you were ten years old.

---

- psychology
- business writing
- accounting
- design (the basics)
- conversation
- overcoming shyness
- second language
- golf
- proper grammar
- persuasion
- technology (hobby level)
- proper voice technique

> Apple owes much of its success to Steve Jobs’s understanding that the way a product makes users feel trumps most other considerations, including price.

---

If you can’t handle the risk of embarrassment, rejection, and failure, you need to learn how, and studies suggest that is indeed a learnable skill.

---

The single biggest trick for manipulating your happiness chemistry is being able to do what you want, when you want.

---

> A person with a flexible schedule and average resources will be happier than a rich person who has everything except a flexible schedule.

---

> In your personal life and you career, consider schedule flexibility when making any big decision.

---

If you are lucky enough to have career options, and only one of them affords a path of continual improvement, choose that one, all else being equal.

---

> The primary culprit in your bad moods is a deficit in one of the big five: flexible schedule, imagination, sleep, diet, and exercise.

---

Recapping the happiness formula:
- eat right
- exercise
- get enough sleep
- imagine an incredible future (even if you don’t believe it)
- work toward a flexible schedule
- do things you can steadily improve at
- help others (if you’ve already helped yourself)
- reduce daily decisions to routine

> Optimists make themselves an easy target for luck to find them.
