As I gazed at my reflection I wondered, Where am I headed? Before that, though, the question was Where have I come to? Where is this place? No, before that even I needed to ask, _Who the hell am I?_

The trip was only an hour and a half, but it felt like I’d taken _a day trip to a far-off foreign land._

_“…Going abroad awakens your own ethnic identity or something.”_

“…there should be a few lessons I should learn. _The courage not to fear a change in one’s lifestyle_, the importance of having time on your side.”

---

> _Everybody has something they speculate and wonder about, no matter how blessed their circumstances._

“There are things people are better off not knowing. That’s all I can say.”\
“But whether you know it or not, it ends up the same. _Sooner or later, suddenly or not suddenly, with a loud knock or a soft one, that’s the only difference._”

“Sometimes I think I’m empty,” he confessed.\
“Empty?”\
“When I was young, I saw no limits to what I could achieve. […] But when I passed fifty, _I looked at myself in the mirror and discovered nothing but emptiness._ A zero. What T. S. Eliot called a ‘straw man’.”

“…You would have to remain here for eternity. The river is cold and deep, and the current is strong. And _eternity is a very long time…_”

She made no sound, but the trembling of her body told me she was still crying. I kept stroking her hair. As if she and I were _heading upstream along the river of time._

---

I couldn’t. I didn’t have the right. … There was but one person in the world who did … But he would never exercise it.\
_We all live our lives carrying secrets we cannot disclose._

“It’s a work in progress, and _I’m a work in progress too, now and forever._”\
“None of us are ever finished. Everyone is always a work in progress.”

> She smiled.
