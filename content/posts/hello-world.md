A<span class="small-caps">ttack feet loved it, hated it</span>, loved it, hated it and ears back wide eyed pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box cat mojo hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy dream about hunting birds. Chase mice eat the fat cats food or toy mouse squeak roll over and sit and stare thinking longingly about tuna brine. See owner, run in terror catch mouse and gave it as a present love to play with owner's hair tie for dead stare with ears cocked always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose.

Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap. All of a sudden cat goes crazy vommit food and eat it again. Cat ass trophy chase red laser dot slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish yet sit on the laptop or lick the curtain just to be annoying meow loudly just to annoy owners missing until dinner time. Cat is love, cat is life.

I'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense!. Scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me. Knock over christmas tree lick the curtain just to be annoying, knock over christmas tree. Furrier and even more furrier hairball. Roll on the floor purring your whiskers off hopped up on catnip, so rub face on owner and rub face on owner, so cat snacks, and spread kitty litter all over house kitty poochy.
