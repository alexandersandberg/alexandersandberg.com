Shortly after the sunsetting announcement, I had already been approached by several companies working on cool things that had heard that I was looking for something new.

With an inspiring mission, a beautiful product, and an amazing team, one opportunity stood out among the rest.

Today Iâ€™m thrilled to announce that I this week joined the team at [Practice](https://practice.do) as an **iOS Developer** to work on the Practice iOS app!
