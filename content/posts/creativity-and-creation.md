"True artists deliver.”

”You can’t stop the waves but you can learn how to surf” - Jon Kabat Zinn

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."

Take naps for creativity (sleeping on a problem).

”The best way to complain is to make something."

”Legacy is not leaving something for people. It’s leaving something in people.”

”When you get lost in a project, choose the first idea, because it’s the correct one.” — Oki Sato

> It's easier to aim high and scale it back than aim low and add more; keep your ideas bold and innovative.

Imagination is the source of every form of human achievement.

Storytelling is very important, from beginning to end. Begin early in the life of a project, and weave it into every aspect of the innovation effort.
