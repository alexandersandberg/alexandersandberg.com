Most of the books I read nowadays are non-fiction books on personal development. For an avid student of life, the pursuit of gathering more knowledge is like an obsession, but I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.

The problem with reading book after book though is remembering everything you learn. Taking notes while reading is a good way to solve this problem. It’s like creating an index of your memory library–aka your brain.

But the reality is that even though you can’t pinpoint all your fragments of knowledge at all times, the effect they had on you still persist. **The world as you know it has changed and you now perceive things in a different way, whether you realise it or not.**
