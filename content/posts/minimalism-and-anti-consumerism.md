”I’d rather lose all my money starting a business than losing it by buying stuff I don’t need.”

> ”A rich person is not one who has the most, but one who needs the least.”

We tend to grossly overestimate the pleasure brought forth by new experiences and underestimate the power of finding meaning in current ones.

Just because you believe something is beautiful, doesn’t mean you have to buy it. You can merely acknowledge that it exists.

”You’re not your job. You’re not how much money you have in the bank. You’re not the car you drive. You’re not the contents of your wallet. You’re not your fucking khakis.” – Tyler Durden

> If you lost it, would you buy it again?

Think of stores as your personal warehouses.

You buy furniture. You tell yourself, this is the last sofa I will ever need in my life. Buy the sofa, then for a couple years you’re satisfied that no matter what goes wrong, at least you’ve got your sofa issue handled. Then the right set of dishes. Then the perfect bed. The drapes. The rug. Then you’re trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you.

If you don’t know what you want, you end up with a lot you don’t.

Worker bees can leave, even drones can fly away. The queen is their slave.

> It is only after you’ve lost everything that you’re free to do anything.

I’m breaking my attachment to physical power and possessions, because only through destroying myself can I discover the greater power of my spirit. The liberator who destroys my property, is fighting to save my spirit. The teacher who clears all possessions from my path will set me free.
