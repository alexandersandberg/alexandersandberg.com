			P("I’m Alex, a self-taught software engineer born and raised in northern Sweden. I currently live in Austria.")
			P("I’m very much driven by curiosity. I’ve always loved creating things, exploring new ideas, and seeking new knowledge to learn from.")
			P("I have a big appreciation for good design and polished experiences and consider myself a product-minded engineer. I actually have a master’s degree in product design as well.")
			P("I’m open-minded; I embrace my mistakes and learn from them. I avoid prejudices and find opposing views to my own fascinating, not threatening.")
			P("I’m an extroverted introvert; while I love meeting new people and exploring new places, I recharge my energy at home.")
			P("I like to keep things simple, both in work and in life. You can usually see this reflected in my creative output.")

		Div {
			P("I think I’ve always had a deep curiosity for learning and creating. As long as I can remember, I’ve always found great joy in reading, puzzling, drawing, building with LEGO… anything creative, really.")
			P("Ever since I wrote my first lines of code back in 2007, when I was 13 years old, most of my creative output has been in the form of software projects—apps, websites, tools.")
			P("I’ve also always been a perfectionist—for better or worse. In later years, this has made me gravitate toward simplicity in my work, and I’ve come to highly regard the work of people like Dieter Rams and Steve Jobs.")
			P("This desire for keeping things simple might also have come from my Scandinavian roots, where minimalism is more than just a design trend.")
			P("At the intersection of my need for innovation and simplistic perfectionism, I have discovered this passion for <em>software tinkering</em>.")
