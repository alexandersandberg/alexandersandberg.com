Was it all worth it?",

Will take time to get used to the size and the weight though.\n\nThanks to the iPhone’s telephoto lens, I can finally leave my mirrorless Fujifilm at home when traveling. It’s not a full replacement, of course, but it’s enough for what I want out of my travel photography.",

Looking forward to spending more time with the camera, and especially the Photographic Styles.\n\nI had too high expectations for the new Camera Control button though. Its position makes it very uncomfortable to use, my phone has a bug where it doesn’t open the camera app with a single click, and it’s simply just easier to use the touchscreen instead.",
