## Someday, I would like to work for the sake of the craft, not to make money

I love tinkering with small indie apps, websites, and other projects without thinking about how to monetize and grow them.

Don’t get me wrong, I love working together with other people on interesting projects too, but I would like to reduce the hours, or maybe do it seasonally, if possible.

I also feel extremely grateful for being able to work on what I love at my full-time job—something some people can only dream of.

But there’s just something about waking up and working—or _not_ working—on whatever inspires you that day. That’s freedom to me.

Usually, people only achieve this kind of freedom when they retire, which is at age 65 or later. I want to “retire” earlier than that, which brings me to my next point…

## Someday, I would like to be financially independent

I don’t want to be rich, I want to be wealthy. I don’t want to be able to afford luxurious items and expensive vacations, I want to be able to only spend time on things that matter the most to me in life: family and friends, rich experiences, meaningful work.

I believe this is only possible once I no longer have to “care” about money. When income and cost no longer have to be factors in my decisions. This means having passive income that covers my expenses.

I realized this in 2016 in my early twenties and have been working towards it ever since. I still have a long way to go, but I’m very excited about it. I might write more about that at some point.

## Someday, I no longer want to care about “making it”

The main reason why I still have a LinkedIn account is because of my fear of missing out of new job opportunities. Despite the fact that I’m currently not looking for anything new, I might have to someday in the future.

As long as I have to work for money, I probably won’t be ready to burn that bridge and delete my LinkedIn account. 

Same goes for my Twitter account. I love connect with and meeting new people on there, but the main reason I haven’t deleted it yet is because it significantly helps the success of my indie apps, which in turn brings me more income.

Even though I don’t spend that much time on these social media services anymore, I still feel like a slave to them. And I hate that.

Once I’m financially independent, I hope that this need for career/work growth will go away, and I can let go of my FOMO—or maybe FONMI (Fear of Not Making It)—and just build cool stuff for the sake of building cool stuff.

Then I just need to figure out a way to keep the social aspects of social media, and I can reduce my online presence to just my personal website and my email address. _This is the dream._

## Someday, I would like to build a home for my family

I have always loved interior design and architecture, and frequently dream about building my own house someday. We’re still not sure about where to put this house—where we want to settle down someday—so figuring this out will probably be the next step.
