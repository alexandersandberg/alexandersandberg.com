Welcome to my personal _home on the internet_ where I share things about myself—what I’m thinking about, what I’m working on, what I aspire towards, etc.

I still publish some content elsewhere, like on Twitter at [@alexandberg](https://twitter.com/alexandberg), but I [someday](/someday/) hope to break free from that. I’m still trying to figure out how.

Like life itself, this website is forever a _work in progress_.

## Technology

This website is generated using a static website generator that I built myself with [Swift](https://swift.org).

It’s using a simple layout system built around `VStack`s and `HStack`s, inspired by [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/).

_Why?_ I simply love working with Swift and SwiftUI, and want to immerse myself in it whenever possible. It was also a fun challenge for me to build my own static website generator.

As the website generator is built with Swift, I use [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) to work on the website.

Updates to the website, including new articles and other content, are pushed to the website’s public GitHub repository at [github.com/alexandersandberg/alexandersandberg.com](https://github.com/alexandersandberg/alexandersandberg.com).

When new changes land on the remote `main` branch, a GitHub Action is triggered which generates the new website files and uploads them to [Bunny Storage](https://bunny.net/storage/), which I use to host the files.

Website images are also hosted by Bunny, but in a separate storage zone. I upload those images manually using their web interface.

The website files and images are then distributed globally with [Bunny CDN](https://bunny.net/cdn/) at lightning speed.

I buy all my domain names at [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com). I bought `alexandersandberg.com` in 2014.

The domain names are pointed to [Bunny DNS](https://bunny.net/dns/).

I like to know how people find my website, so I use [Plausible](https://plausible.io) for _anonymous_ analytics and check the referral sources once in a while.

## Carbon footprint

Thanks to this being a static website, only `0.0026g` CO² is produced per visit, according to [websitecarbon.com](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/alexandersandberg-com/).

The global average is 300 times more at around `0.8g` CO² per visit.
