## Balance 2

I’m making good progress on the complete redesign and rewrite of Balance. I have started sharing some previews in my [/notes feed](/notes/).

## Increasing indie MRR

As part of [my strive for freedom and independence](/someday/), I want to someday have _the option_ of making my indie apps my full-time job. I’m currently ~10% of the way there in terms of MRR.

## Getting married

I got engaged to the love of my life at the end of last year, and this summer we’re getting married! I’ve quickly learned how much there is to do for the wedding, but it’s also really exciting!

## Planning to move somewhere else

We like it where we live now, but it’s not the place we eventually want to settle down at. In the next few years, we would like to figure out where that is, and have started planning for that.

## Spending less time in front of the computer

I would like to spend more time outside and away from the computer. I _try_ to stick to at least one computer-free day every weekend, but it’s easier said than done considering most of my hobbies are digital, not analog.
