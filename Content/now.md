## Got married

At the end of July I married the love of my life and best friend. It was an absolutely amazing day that I will cherish forever! ü§ç

## Balance 2

The complete redesign and rewrite of Balance is finally live! I wrote [a short article about it](/articles/balance-2/).

## Increasing indie MRR

As part of [my strive for freedom and independence](/someday/), I want to someday have _the option_ of making my indie apps my full-time job. I‚Äôm currently ~10% of the way there in terms of MRR.

## Planning to move somewhere else

We like it where we live now, but it‚Äôs not the place we eventually want to settle down at. In the next few years, we would like to figure out where that is, and have started planning for that.

## Spending less time in front of the computer

I would like to spend more time outside and away from the computer. I _try_ to stick to at least one computer-free day every weekend, but it‚Äôs easier said than done considering most of my hobbies are digital, not analog.
