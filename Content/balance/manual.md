I’m still working on updating the manual for the new version of Balance. Sorry about that!

In the meantime, you can check out the FAQ below or reach out to me for any questions or feedback by [sending me an email.](mailto:hi@alexandersandberg.com?subject=Balance Manual")

Thank you for your patience! :)

## FAQ

### Is there an iOS/iPadOS app?

Not yet, but I have started working on one! If you would like to request features, stay up-to-date with the latest, and (once available) receive an invite to the iOS/iPadOS beta, you can [join the Balance community](https://trybalance.app/community/).

### Do you support Family Sharing for purchases?

Yes! All subscriptions and lifetime plans in Balance can be shared with your family. If you need help setting this up, check out [Apple’s documentation](https://www.apple.com/family-sharing/) or [send me an email](mailto:hi@alexandersandberg.com?subject=Balance Family Sharing") and I’ll help you out.

### Do you provide student discounts?

Yes! Balance is a great tool for studying and I provide students with discounts on the Pro plans. [Reach out to me](mailto:hi@alexandersandberg.com?subject=Balance student discount") from your student email address and I will get back to you as soon as possible!
