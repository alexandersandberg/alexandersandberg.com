After [sunsetting Tempo](/articles/sunsetting-tempo/) just over two weeks ago, it didn’t take long before I was longing for something new. Working on a product that I loved together with talented people inspired me to look for my next exciting opportunity.

Shortly after the announcement, I had already been approached by several companies working on cool things that had heard that I was looking for something new.

With an inspiring mission, a beautiful product, and an amazing team, one opportunity stood out among the rest.

## My next thing

Today I’m thrilled to announce that I this week joined the team at [Practice](https://practice.do) as a *Lead iOS Engineer* to work on the Practice iOS app!

Practice is building a tool that helps individuals launch and run their entire coaching and consulting businesses in one place.

We’re backed by some truly world-class investors and recently closed a round of $10m led by [Andrew Chen](https://twitter.com/andrewchen) of [a16z](https://a16z.com), which, among other great people, includes the #1 life & business strategist [Tony Robbins](https://www.tonyrobbins.com).

While I will continue spending part of my days on my own ideas for a few more weeks, I’m incredibly excited to join the amazing team at Practice to build great things together.
