I‚Äôm very excited to be one of the inaugural members of the [Swift Website Workgroup](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-website-work-group/57273) (SWWG)!

Together with the Swift core team and the community, we will guide the evolution of Swift.org to make it an even better resource for everyone.

## The workgroup

The workgroup has been established following the [announcement](https://www.swift.org/blog/website-open-source/) of Apple‚Äôs decision to open-source Swift.org. With these changes, the whole Swift community will be able to participate and contribute to the future of the website.

The workgroup will define processes that govern contributions, actively guide website development and contributions, define and prioritize efforts, and make sure that the community‚Äôs feedback is heard.

You can learn more about our goals [here](https://www.swift.org/website-workgroup/).

## Participating

If you‚Äôre interested in contributing to the future of Swift.org, you can learn more about how you can participate [here](https://www.swift.org/website/).

You can find (and star ‚≠êÔ∏è) the Swift.org repository on GitHub at [swiftlang/swift-org-website](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-org-website/).

The Swift website was (and still is) my go-to resource for anything Swift-related, but there is a lot of potential for making it even better. I‚Äôm looking forward to working closely together with the Swift core team, the other SWWG members, and the Swift community on this.

You can now [reach out](mailto:hi@alexandersandberg.com) to me about anything related to the Swift.org website‚Äôs evolution. You can also [contact SWWG directly](https://forums.swift.org/new-message?groupname=swift-website-workgroup) via the Swift forums.

There is a [special section](https://forums.swift.org/c/swift-website/84) on the forums for anything related to the Swift website.

See you there! üôÇ
