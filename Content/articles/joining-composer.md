About 2 months ago I [announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexandberg/status/1701974045195989282) that I was looking for a new full-time opportunity. I was overwhelmed with the reach that the tweet got, and I’m super grateful to everyone who shared this with others.*

After taking a few weeks off in October, I’m very excited to have joined [Composer](https://www.composer.trade) this week as their *first iOS Engineer!*

Composer is an automated trading platform that allows you to build, test, deploy, and manage automated investing strategies—all without writing a single line of code.

I look forward to working closely together with the rest of the team on bringing this great product to iOS and the App Store.
